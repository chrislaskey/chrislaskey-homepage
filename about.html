<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="intro">I am a Software Engineer and Founder of <a href="https://evelion.org" target="_blank">Evelion</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a Software Architect and Manager at IBM. Before that, I was a senior software engineer and team lead at Blue Box.</p>

<p>I've also been the Director of Information Technology at CELEST, a multi-million dollar a year NSF funded computational neuroscience center at Boston University. I started my career as a developer at Raka Creative, a high-end boutique creative studio in Portsmouth New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Outside of work I enjoy weightlifting, running, and film photography. Most days I can be found at the park with my family and golden retriever. I live in Swampscott, Massachusetts and hold two bachelorâ€™s degrees from Boston University in Philosophy and Ancient Greek.</p>
